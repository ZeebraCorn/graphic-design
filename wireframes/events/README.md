# Events

This project was a design project for a friend for a fictional company where you can search for events both near you and based on event title. In the design my friend wanted a color palette focusing on the color from the logotype with a combination of black, white and greys. Every event is a card where you can see a picture, location, date and time. Every event is in a category and all categories have different colors to easily navigate through them. 

Figma was used for this project.
