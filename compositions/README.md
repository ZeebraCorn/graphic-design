# Mekonomen Posters

The project was to make a launching poster for the fictional reopening of a mechanic workshop. The project had to include a person, a car, a workshop building and signs for opening hours and company name. I made two versions to try out different techniques and images. The third image is a visualization of how it could look on a bus stop. 

Adobe Photoshop was used for this project.
