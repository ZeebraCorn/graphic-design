# Graphic Profile

The project was to update the school's graphic profile. The project consisted of making the profile more cohesive. Make a free zone for both versions of the logotype, show how the logotype could look on clothing and other relevant objects and show the typography and colors. The logotype, graphic element and copy text was provided by the school. 

Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop was used for this project.
