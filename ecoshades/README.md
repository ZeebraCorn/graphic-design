# Ecoshades

## Logotype
The idea behind the logotype was to make a modern logo that could fit on the frame of a pair of sunglasses. I wanted to make the word “eco” stand out but not with green that is often used to display eco products, instead I chose a turquoise color that is similar to green but more modern. The font was made by using a golden ratio grid and creating the letters. 

Adobe Illustrator was used for this project.

## Style Tile
I chose a color palette where the turquoise was the accent color and combined that with black, greys and white to make the turquoise stand out. For the headline font I chose a rounded font that matches the logotype. For the body text I chose a font that harmonizes with the headline and logotype but is still readable. 

Adobe XD was used for this project.

## Wireframe
I wanted the sunglasses to be the main focus. The headlines and body text is all in lowercase by choice to match the logotype. Most of the photographs of sunglasses are shot by me and then isolated and added shadow in photoshop. 

Figma was used for this project.
