# Bj√∂rns Korv och Chark

A school project for a fictional charcuterie company. The task was to make a package design for different kinds of sausages. The main color design matches the flavor in the sausages. Red for habanero, yellow for cheddar and green for the vegetarian option.

Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop was used for this project.
