A logotype for a local cat shelter in Norrk√∂ping. 
I wanted to make a simple logo with some symbol to make it stand out a bit more. I sketched a few different designs but chose the cat ears. For colors I went with blue to symbolize trust and green to symbolize nature, both something that you would want to associate with the shelter. 

Adobe Illustrator was used for this project.
